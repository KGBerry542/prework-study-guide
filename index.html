        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base elment defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link elemnt connects an external reasource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is a declaration that tells the brwoser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li> Lang="en" is an attribute tag inside of the html tag which tells the browser the language for the webpage(in this case "en" is for english).</html></li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Very useful for quick and permanebt changes.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet is used to style an individual webpage.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>External style sheets need to be linked by using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>Img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
